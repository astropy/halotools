Step-by-step guide to managing halo catalogs 
********************************************************************

In these notes we will describe the process of halo catalog management, 
start-to-finish. We'll start out with the section :ref:`using_preprocessed_halocats`, 
which will describe how to download and quickly begin using 
the pre-processed binary reductions provided by the Halotools team. 
Then, in :ref:`using_raw_halocats`, we'll walk you through how to download  
raw ASCII data, choose your own cuts, and produce and manage your own binaries. 


.. _using_preprocessed_halocats:

Using pre-processed binary files
====================================

If you followed the instructions given in :ref:`first_steps` 
in the :ref:`getting_started` section of the documentation, 
then you already have at least one pre-processed binary halo catalog in your cache. 
If you haven't done that yet, you'll find it easier to follow these instructions if you 
go ahead and do that before navigating to :ref:`using_halocat_binaries`. 


.. _using_raw_halocats:

Starting from scratch with raw ASCII
=======================================

If you would like to learn how to start from scratch with raw ASCII data from one of the halo catalogs supported by Halotools, then navigate to :ref:`raw_halocats_tutorial`.
