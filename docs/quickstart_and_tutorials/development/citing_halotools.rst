Citing Halotools
------------------

Halotools is currently preparing for its first "official" public release (v0.2). 
The v0.2 release will be accompanied with a code-release paper, currently 
being housed and developed in the repository stored here: 
https://github.com/aphearin/halotools_release_paper. 

If you use Halotools modules to support your science publication, 
we ask that you cite this paper in your work. A link to the source of the paper will be added to this section of the documentation as soon as the release-paper is submitted. 

Because Halotools is a large package 
with modular functionality, explicitly stating which features you used 
(and which version of the package you used) will promote the reproducibility 
of your results. If you used one of the Halotools-provided catalogs, 
be sure to explicitly declare which catalog, including its ``version_name``. 

Throughout the course of your project, 
one of the Halotools development team may support your work by incorporating a new feature 
into Halotools, and/or by accelerating the development of an existing feature branch 
for the sake of your project. 
In such an event, please consider a co-authorship invitation for that member of the development team 
in addition to citing the Halotools release-paper. 
You can always request such support by 
either a private email or by raising a public issue on GitHub and 
tagging the issue with the ``feature request`` label and/or ``question`` label.
