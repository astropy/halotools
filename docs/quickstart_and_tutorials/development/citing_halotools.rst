Citing Halotools
------------------

The first release of Halotools (v0.2) was accompanied with a code-release paper, http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04106. If you use Halotools modules to support your science publication,
we ask that you cite this paper in your work, ideally taking note of the version of the code you used, e.g., v0.7.

Depending on what you use Halotools to do, there may be additional citations that are appropriate.
For example, if you use a model in the `~halotools.empirical_models` sub-package
and/or a simulation in the `~halotools.sim_manager` sub-package that has
a ``publications`` attribute, each of the papers in that list should be cited.

Throughout the course of your project,
one of the Halotools development team may support your work by incorporating a new feature
into Halotools, and/or by accelerating the development of an existing feature branch
for the sake of your project.
In such an event, please consider a co-authorship invitation for that member of the development team
in addition to the above citations.
You can always request such support by
either slack or personal email, or by raising a public issue on GitHub and
tagging the issue with the ``feature request`` label and/or ``question`` label.
