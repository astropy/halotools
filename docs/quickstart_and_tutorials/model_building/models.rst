Tutorial on modeling the galaxy-halo connection

.. currentmodule:: halotools.empirical_models

Halotools provides a broad range of options for 
studying the connection between galaxies and 
their dark matter halos. These options fall into 
one of three categories. First, the package comes pre-loaded 
with a small collection of specific models 
very similar to those in the published literature, 
including default values set to the best-fit published values. 
Second, once you have any model in hand, 
it's straightforward to toggle the model parameters, and/or swap out 
individual features to create companion models. 
Finally, for the most flexibility, 
there are modules allowing you create a composite model by 
composing the behavior of a set of component models. 
We describe each of these three modes of model-building below.
