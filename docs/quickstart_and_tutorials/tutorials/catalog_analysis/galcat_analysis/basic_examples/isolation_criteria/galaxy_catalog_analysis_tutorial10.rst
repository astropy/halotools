Galaxy Catalog Analysis Example: Identifying isolated galaxies
==============================================================

In this tutorial, we'll start from a mock galaxy catalog and show how to
determine which galaxies are "isolated" according to a variety of
criteria.

There is also an IPython Notebook in the following location that can be 
used as a companion to the material in this section of the tutorial:


    **halotools/docs/notebooks/galcat_analysis/basic_examples/galaxy_catalog_analysis_tutorial10.ipynb**

By following this tutorial together with this notebook, 
you can play around with your own variations of the calculation 
as you learn the basic syntax. 


Generate a mock galaxy catalog
------------------------------

Let's start out by generating a mock galaxy catalog into an N-body
simulation in the usual way. Here we'll assume you have the
:math:``z=0`` rockstar halos for the bolshoi simulation, as this is the
default halo catalog.

.. code:: python

    from halotools.empirical_models import PrebuiltSubhaloModelFactory
    model = PrebuiltSubhaloModelFactory('smhm_binary_sfr')

    from halotools.sim_manager import CachedHaloCatalog
    halocat = CachedHaloCatalog(simname = 'bolshoi', redshift = 0, halo_finder = 'rockstar')
    
    model.populate_mock(halocat)

Now suppose the data we are interested in is complete for
:math:`M_{\ast} > 10^{10}M_{\odot},` so we will make a cut on the mock.
Our mock galaxies are stored in the ``galaxy_table`` of ``model.mock``
in the form of an Astropy ``Table``.

.. code:: python

    sample_mask = model.mock.galaxy_table['stellar_mass'] > 1e10
    gals = model.mock.galaxy_table[sample_mask]

Example 1: Isolation in 3d
--------------------------

For the first example we'll find "isolated" galaxies using simple
spherical isolation: a galaxy will be said to be isolated if no other
galaxy resides within a sphere of size ``r_max``.

.. code:: python

    from halotools.mock_observables import spherical_isolation

The calling signature of `~halotools.mock_observables.spherical_isolation` accepts a
multi-dimensional array storing the x, y, z positions of each point. You
can place your points into the appropriate form using
`numpy.vstack([x, y, z]).T`, but below we'll demo how to use the
`~halotools.mock_observables.return_xyz_formatted_array` function for
this purpose, as this function provides additional convenient behavior
that we'll use later in the tutorial.

.. code:: python

    from halotools.mock_observables import return_xyz_formatted_array
    sample1 = return_xyz_formatted_array(gals['x'], gals['y'], gals['z'])

The `~halotools.mock_observables.spherical_isolation` function accepts distinct inputs for
``sample1`` and ``sample2``. The calculation is designed to treat
``sample2`` points as the tracer field, and ``sample1`` the points for
which you would like to apply the isolation criteria, so that for each
point in ``sample1``, the points in ``sample2`` will be searched for
neighbors. Thus if you pass in ``sample1`` as both arguments, you will
search for points in ``sample1`` that are isolated from other points in
``sample1``.

.. code:: python

    r_max = 0.5 # Note that all lengths are in Mpc/h units throughout Halotools
    is_isolated = spherical_isolation(sample1, sample1, r_max, period = model.mock.Lbox)

The returned result ``is_isolated`` is a boolean array; for any galaxy
for which the corresponding entry is ``True``, there are no other
galaxies within 500 kpc/h in the ``gals`` table.

Example 2: Isolation in redshift-space
--------------------------------------

In this next example we'll show how to apply isolation criteria in a
more observationally realistic manner: first we place galaxies into
redshift-space, and then we apply separate conditions for the
perpendicular and line-of-sight directions.

.. code:: python

    from halotools.mock_observables import cylindrical_isolation

    sample1 = return_xyz_formatted_array(gals['x'], gals['y'], gals['z'], 
                velocity=gals['vz'], velocity_distortion_dimension = 'z', period = model.mock.Lbox)

Now let's define the notion of isolation to mean that no other galaxies
lies within a projected distance of 300 kpc/h and a line-of-sight
distance of 500 km/s. All units in Halotools assume *h=1*, with lengths
always in Mpc/h, so we have:

.. code:: python

    rp_max = 0.3

Since *h=1* implies :math:`H_{0} = 100` km/s/Mpc, our 500 km/s velocity
criteria gets transformed into a z-dimension length criteria as:

.. code:: python

    H0 = 100.0
    pi_max = 500./H0

    is_isolated = cylindrical_isolation(sample1, sample1, rp_max, pi_max, period = model.mock.Lbox)

Example 3: Determining isolation from massive galaxies
------------------------------------------------------

In this final example, we'll show how to formulate a different variation
of isolation: let's determine which galaxies in our sample are isolated
from massive galaxies with :math:`M_{\ast} > 3\times10^{11}M_{\odot}.`

This variation can be handled simply: we just use two different samples
of galaxies. We'll demonstrate this using the ``mask`` feature of
``return_xyz_formatted_array``, but you can of course apply your own
mask manually.

.. code:: python

    sample1 = return_xyz_formatted_array(gals['x'], gals['y'], gals['z'], 
                velocity=gals['vz'], velocity_distortion_dimension = 'z', period = model.mock.Lbox)

    sm_cut = 3e11
    sample2 = return_xyz_formatted_array(gals['x'], gals['y'], gals['z'], 
                velocity=gals['vz'], velocity_distortion_dimension = 'z', period = model.mock.Lbox, 
                mask = gals['stellar_mass'] > sm_cut)

    rp_max = 5 # projected separation cut of 5 Mpc/h
    pi_max = 3000./H0 # line-of-sight velocity cut of 3000 km/s
    
    is_isolated = cylindrical_isolation(sample1, sample2, rp_max, pi_max, period = model.mock.Lbox)
