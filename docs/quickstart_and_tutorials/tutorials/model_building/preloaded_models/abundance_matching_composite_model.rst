Traditional Abundance Matching Model
*********************************************

Halotools does not provide an implementation of traditional SHAM.
See the `deconvolution abundance matching code <https://bitbucket.org/yymao/abundancematching/>`_
for a fast and well-written code written by Yao-Yuan Mao
that provides a python wrapper around the deconvolution kernel written by Peter Behroozi.
