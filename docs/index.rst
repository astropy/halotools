Halotools Documentation
=======================


Halotools is a specialized python package for building and testing models of the
galaxy-halo connection, and analyzing catalogs of dark matter halos.
The core functionality of the package includes:

* Fast generation of synthetic galaxy populations using HODs, abundance matching, and related methods
* Efficient algorithms for calculating galaxy clustering, lensing, z-space distortions, and other astronomical statistics
* A modular, object-oriented framework for designing your own galaxy evolution model
* End-to-end support for downloading publicly-available halo catalogs and reducing them to fast-loading hdf5 files

For more information about the scope of the package, see :ref:`halotools_science_overview`. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/astropy/halotools.
