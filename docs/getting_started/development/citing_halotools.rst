Citing Halotools
------------------

Halotools is currently in alpha-status. The first official package release in early-2016 will be 
accompanied by a code-release paper, which we will ask that you cite if your scientific publication 
uses Halotools for supporting calculations. If you use Halotools modules in your publication prior to that time, 
we ask that you simply acknowledge that you have used the package and provide a link in your paper to the source code, 
https://github.com/astropy/halotools.
