*****************************************************
Simulations and halo catalogs supported by Halotools
*****************************************************

Halotools is configured to download, process and manage a range of  
simulations and halo catalogs. 
For each supported simulation, there are pre-processed binaries available 
for download for redshifts z = 0, 0.5, 1, and 2. 
Halo catalogs based on the Rockstar halo-finder are available for all 
of the simulations below; for Bolshoi, BDM-based catalogs are also available. 
To see simple examples of how to manipulate the data stored in halo catalogs, 
see the Examples section of the `~halotools.sim_manager.MarfMarfMarf` API documentation. 

Below we give a 
brief description of each of the simulations supported by the package.
If you would like to use your own catalog, rather than one of the simulations listed below, 
see the :ref:`using_your_own_catalog`. 

Bolshoi
========
Cosmological N-body simulation of WMAP5 cosmology 
with Lbox = 250 Mpc/h and particle mass of ~1e8 Msun/h. 

For a detailed description of the simulation specs, see 
http://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/multidark-project/bolshoi. 

Bolshoi-Planck 
===============
Cosmological N-body simulation of Planck 2013 cosmology 
with Lbox = 250 Mpc/h and particle mass of ~1e8 Msun/h. 

For a detailed description of the simulation specs, see 
http://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/bolshoip-project/bolshoip/. 

Multidark 
==========
Cosmological N-body simulation of WMAP5 cosmology 
with Lbox = 1Gpc/h and particle mass of ~1e10 Msun/h. 

For a detailed description of the simulation specs, see 
http://www.cosmosim.org/cms/simulations/multidark-project/mdr1. 

Consuelo
=========
Cosmological N-body simulation of WMAP5-like cosmology 
with Lbox = 400 Mpc/h and particle mass of ~1e9 Msun/h.
