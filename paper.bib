abstract = {We present the first stable release of Halotools (v0.2), a community-driven Python package designed to build and test models of the galaxy-halo connection. Halotools provides a modular platform for creating mock universes of galaxies starting from a catalog of dark matter halos obtained from a cosmological simulation. The package supports many of the common forms used to describe galaxy-halo models: the halo occupation distribution, the conditional luminosity function, abundance matching, and alternatives to these models that include effects such as environmental quenching or variable galaxy assembly bias. Satellite galaxies can be modeled to live in subhalos or to follow custom number density profiles within their halos, including spatial and/or velocity bias with respect to the dark matter profile. The package has an optimized toolkit to make mock observations on a synthetic galaxy population—including galaxy clustering, galaxy–galaxy lensing, galaxy group identification, RSD multipoles, void statistics, pairwise velocities and others—allowing direct comparison to observations. Halotools is object-oriented, enabling complex models to be built from a set of simple, interchangeable components, including those of your own creation. Halotools has an automated testing suite and is exhaustively documented on  http://halotools.readthedocs.io, which includes quickstart guides, source code notes and a large collection of tutorials. The documentation is effectively an online textbook on how to build and study empirical models of galaxy formation with Python.}

In this paper, we use the halo model formalism to capture this diversity and examine its implications for Stage-III and Stage-IV cosmic shear surveys. We account for the different IA signatures at large and small scales, as well as for the different contributions from central/satellite and red/blue galaxies, and we use realistic mocks to account for the characteristics of the galaxy populations as a function of redshift. We inform our model using the most recent observational findings: we include a luminosity dependence at both large and small scales and a radial dependence of the signal within the halo. We predict the impact of the total IA signal on the lensing angular power spectra, including the current uncertainties from the IA best-fits to illustrate the range of possible impact on the lensing signal: the lack of constraints for fainter galaxies is the main source of uncertainty for our predictions of the IA signal. We investigate how well effective models with limited degrees of freedom can account for the complexity of the IA signal. Although these lead to negligible biases for Stage-III surveys, we find that, for Stage-IV surveys, it is essential to at least include an additional parameter to capture the redshift dependence.}",

    abstract = "{Intrinsic galaxy alignments constitute the major astrophysical systematic of forthcoming weak gravitational lensing surveys but also yield unique insights into galaxy formation and evolution. We build analytic models for the distribution of galaxy shapes based on halo properties extracted from the Millennium Simulation, differentiating between early- and late-type galaxies as well as central galaxies and satellites. The resulting ellipticity correlations are investigated for their physical properties and compared to a suite of current observations. The best-faring model is then used to predict the intrinsic alignment contamination of planned weak lensing surveys. We find that late-type galaxy models generally have weak intrinsic ellipticity correlations, marginally increasing towards smaller galaxy separation and higher redshift. The signal for early-type models at fixed halo mass strongly increases by three orders of magnitude over two decades in galaxy separation, and by one order of magnitude from z = 0 to z = 2. The intrinsic alignment strength also depends strongly on halo mass, but not on galaxy luminosity at fixed mass, or galaxy number density in the environment. We identify models that are in good agreement with all observational data, except that all models overpredict alignments of faint early-type galaxies. The best model yields an intrinsic alignment contamination of a Euclid-like survey between 0.5 and 10 per cent at z \\&gt; 0.6 and on angular scales larger than a few arcminutes. Cutting 20 per cent of red foreground galaxies using observer-frame colours can suppress this contamination by up to a factor of 2.}",

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {Weak gravitational lensing has become a powerful probe of large-scale structure and cosmological parameters.  Precision weak lensing measurements require an understanding of the intrinsic alignment of galaxy ellipticities, which can in turn inform models of galaxy formation.  It is hypothesized that elliptical galaxies align with the background tidal field and that this alignment mechanism dominates the correlation between ellipticities on cosmological scales (in the absence of lensing).  We use recent large-scale structure measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to test this picture with several statistics: (1) the correlation between ellipticity and galaxy overdensity, wg+; (2) the intrinsic alignment auto-correlation functions; (3) the correlation functions of curl-free, E, and divergence-free, B, modes, the latter of which is zero in the linear tidal alignment theory; (4) the alignment correlation function, wg(rp,θ), a recently developed statistic that generalizes the galaxy correlation function to account for the angle between the galaxy separation vector and the principle axis of ellipticity.  We show that recent measurements are largely consistent with the tidal alignment model and discuss dependence on galaxy luminosity.  In addition, we show that at linear order the tidal alignment model predicts that the angular dependence of wg(rp,θ) is simply wg+(rp)cos (2θ) and that this dependence is consistent with recent measurements.  We also study how stochastic nonlinear contributions to galaxy ellipticity impact these statistics.  We find that a significant fraction of the observed LRG ellipticity can be explained by alignment with the tidal field on scales ≳ 10 \hMpc.  These considerations are relevant to galaxy formation and evolution.}

In the absence of perfectly known galaxy redshifts, some modelling of the galaxy intrinsic alignments is likely to be required to extract the lensing signal to sufficient accuracy. We present a new model based on the placement of galaxies into dark matter haloes. The central galaxy ellipticity follows the large-scale potential and, in the simplest case, the satellite galaxies point at the halo centre. The two-halo term is then dominated by the linear-alignment model and the one-halo term provides a motivated extension of intrinsic alignment models to small scales. We provide fitting formulae for the spatial projected source power spectra for both intrinsic–intrinsic (II) and gravitational–intrinsic (GI) correlations. We illustrate the potential impact of ignoring intrinsic alignments on cosmological parameter constraints from non-tomographic surveys, finding that σ8 could be underestimated by up to the size of the current 1σ error bar from cosmic shear if very small scales are included in the analysis. Finally, we highlight areas of interest for numerical simulations of dark matter clustering and galaxy formation that can further constrain the intrinsic alignment signal.}",

    abstract = "{In order to prepare for the upcoming wide-field cosmological surveys, large simulations of the Universe with realistic galaxy populations are required. In particular, the tendency of galaxies to naturally align towards overdensities, an effect called intrinsic alignments (IA), can be a major source of systematics in the weak lensing analysis. As the details of galaxy formation and evolution relevant to IA cannot be simulated in practice on such volumes, we propose as an alternative a Deep Generative Model. This model is trained on the IllustrisTNG-100 simulation and is capable of sampling the orientations of a population of galaxies so as to recover the correct alignments. In our approach, we model the cosmic web as a set of graphs, where the graphs are constructed for each halo, and galaxy orientations as a signal on those graphs. The generative model is implemented on a Generative Adversarial Network architecture and uses specifically designed Graph-Convolutional Networks sensitive to the relative 3D positions of the vertices. Given (sub)halo masses and tidal fields, the model is able to learn and predict scalar features such as galaxy and dark matter subhalo shapes; and more importantly, vector features such as the 3D orientation of the major axis of the ellipsoid and the complex 2D ellipticities. For correlations of 3D orientations the model is in good quantitative agreement with the measured values from the simulation, except for at very small and transition scales. For correlations of 2D ellipticities, the model is in good quantitative agreement with the measured values from the simulation on all scales. Additionally, the model is able to capture the dependence of IA on mass, morphological type, and central/satellite type.}",

abstract = {We present a detailed nonspherical modeling of dark matter halos on the basis of a combined analysis of high-resolution halo simulations (12 halos with N ~ 106 particles within their virial radius) and large cosmological simulations (five realizations with N = 5123 particles in a 100 h-1 Mpc box size). The density profiles of those simulated halos are well approximated by a sequence of the concentric triaxial distribution with their axis directions being fairly aligned. We characterize the triaxial model quantitatively by generalizing the universal density profile, that has previously been discussed only in the framework of the spherical model. We obtain a series of practically useful fitting formulae in applying the triaxial model: the mass and redshift dependence of the axis ratio, the mean of the concentration parameter, and the probability distribution functions of the axis ratio and the concentration parameter. These accurate fitting formulae form a complete description of the triaxial density profiles of halos in cold dark matter models. Our current description of the dark halos will be particularly useful in predicting a variety of nonsphericity effects, to a reasonably reliable degree, including the weak and strong lens statistics, the orbital evolution of galactic satellites and triaxiality of galactic halos, and the nonlinear clustering of dark matter. In addition, this provides a useful framework for the nonspherical modeling of the intracluster gas, which is crucial in discussing the gas and temperature profiles of X-ray clusters and the Hubble constant estimated via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect.}

These two simulations allow us to measure the distributions of  halo shapes down to 10\% of the virial radius over a halo mass range of  6 × 109–2 × 1014 h−1M⊙.    We largely confirm previous results on the distributions of halo axis ratios as a function of  halo mass, but we find that the median angle between halo major axes at different halo radii can vary by a factor of 2 between the  Millennium-1 and 2 simulations because of the different mass resolution.  Thus, error in the shape  determinations from limited resolution is potentially  degenerate with the misalignment of halo inner and outer shapes  used to constrain  Brightest Cluster Galaxy alignments in previous works. We also present simplifying parameterizations for the 3-D halo-mass alignment correlation functions that are necessary ingredients for triaxial halo models of large-scale structure and models of galaxy intrinsic alignments as contaminants for cosmic shear surveys.  We measure strong alignments between halos of all masses and the surrounding dark matter overdensities  out to several tens of h−1 Mpc, in agreement with observed  shear-galaxy and cluster shape correlations.    We use these measurements to forecast the contribution to the weak lensing  signal around galaxy clusters from correlated mass along the line-of-sight.  For prolate clusters with major axes aligned with the line-of-sight the fraction of the weak lensing  signal from mass external to the cluster can be twice that predicted if the excess  halo alignment correlation is assumed to be zero.}

Although these distributions are natural for modelling axially symmetric data (i.e., unit vectors where ±x are equivalent), for high-dimensions using them can be difficult—largely because for Watson distributions even basic tasks such as maximum-likelihood are numerically challenging. To tackle the numerical difficulties some approximations have been derived. But these are either grossly inaccurate in high-dimensions [K.V. Mardia, P. Jupp, Directional Statistics, second ed., John Wiley & Sons, 2000] or when reasonably accurate [A. Bijral, M. Breitenbach, G.Z. Grudic, Mixture of Watson distributions: a generative model for hyperspherical embeddings, in: Artificial Intelligence and Statistics, AISTATS 2007, 2007, pp. 35–42], they lack theoretical justification. We derive new approximations to the maximum-likelihood estimates; our approximations are theoretically well-defined, numerically accurate, and easy to compute. We build on our parameter estimation and discuss mixture-modelling with Watson distributions; here we uncover a hitherto unknown connection to the “diametrical clustering” algorithm of Dhillon et al. [I.S. Dhillon, E.M. Marcotte, U. Roshan, Diametrical clustering for identifying anticorrelated gene clusters, Bioinformatics 19 (13) (2003) 1612–1619].}

We also report halo mass accretion rates and concentrations. We show that the higher cosmological matter density of the Planck parameters compared with the WMAP parameters leads to higher abundance of massive haloes at high redshifts. We find that the median halo spin parameter \\$\\{\\lambda \_\\{\\rm B\\}\\}= J(\\sqrt\\{2\\}M\_\\{\\rm vir\\}R\_\\{\\rm vir\\}V\_\\{\\rm vir\\})^\\{-1\\}\\$ is nearly independent of redshift, leading to predicted evolution of galaxy sizes that is consistent with observations, while the significant decrease with redshift in median \\$\\{\\lambda \_\\{\\rm P\\}\\}= J|E|^\\{-1/2\\}G^\\{-1\\}M^\\{-5/2\\}\\$ predicts more decrease in galaxy sizes than is observed. Using the Tully–Fisher and Faber–Jackson relations between galaxy velocity and mass, we show that a simple model of how galaxy velocity is related to halo maximum circular velocity leads to increasing overprediction of cosmic stellar mass density as redshift increases beyond z ∼ 1, implying that such velocity–mass relations must change at z ≳ 1. By making a realistic model of how observed galaxy velocities are related to halo circular velocity, we show that recent optical and radio observations of the abundance of galaxies are in good agreement with our ΛCDM simulations. Our halo demographics are based on updated versions of the Rockstar and Consistent Trees codes, and this paper includes appendices explaining all of their outputs. This paper is an introduction to a series of related papers presenting other analyses of the Bolshoi–Planck and MultiDark–Planck simulations.}",

Using mock catalogues of lenses and sources, we disentangle the various contributions to the covariance matrix and compare them with a simple analytical model. We show that not subtracting the lensing measurement around random points from the measurement around the lens sample is equivalent to performing the measurement using the lens density field instead of the lens overdensity field. While the measurement using the lens density field is unbiased (in the absence of systematics), its error is significantly larger due to an additional term in the covariance. Therefore, this subtraction should be performed regardless of its beneficial effects on systematics. Comparing the error estimates from data and mocks for estimators that involve the overdensity, we find that the errors are dominated by the shape noise and lens clustering, which empirically estimated covariances (jackknife and standard deviation across mocks) that are consistent with theoretical estimates, and that both the connected parts of the four-point function and the supersample covariance can be neglected for the current levels of noise. While the trade-off between different terms in the covariance depends on the survey configuration (area, source number density), the diagnostics that we use in this work should be useful for future works to test their empirically determined covariances.}",

We explore TNG100, a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2 × 25003 resolution elements in a volume 20 times larger. Here, we present first results on the galaxy colour bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g − r) colours of 109 \\&lt; M⋆/M⊙ \\&lt; 1012.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement with the observations, with a sharp transition in median colour from blue to red at a characteristic M⋆ ∼ 1010.5 M⊙. Investigating the build-up of the colour–mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy colour transition is supermassive black hole feedback in its low accretion state. Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale Δtgreen is ∼1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M⋆ \\&gt; 1011 M⊙ which redden at z \\&lt; 1 accumulate on average ∼25 per cent of their final z = 0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, ∼18 per cent of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.}",

Here, we introduce the first two simulations of the series, TNG100 and TNG300, and quantify the stellar mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters (1013 ≤ M200c/M⊙ ≤ 1015) at recent times (z ≤ 1). The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intracluster light. Haloes more massive than about 5 × 1014 M⊙ have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( − 3.5 ≲ α3D ≲ −3). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as ∝(M500c)0.49 with a ∼0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies ( ≲ 1011 M⊙ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (∼0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with \\$r^\\{\\rm stars\\}\_\\{\\rm 0.5\\} \\propto (M\_\\{\\rm 200c\\})^\\{0.53\\}\\$. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kiloparsecs, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single-mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.}",

Here we investigate the elemental distributions of stars in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M⋆/M⊙) ∼ 9.7–11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star–neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z ≈ 2–4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.}",

Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ∼ 10 h Mpc−1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z ≃ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109–1010 h−2 M⊙. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope γ is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from γ ∼ 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to γ ∼ 1.6 at redshift z ∼ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around ∼ 5 per cent.}",

Here we focus on the general properties of magnetic fields and the diffuse radio emission in galaxy clusters. Magnetic fields are prevalent in galaxies, and their build-up is closely linked to structure formation. We find that structure formation amplifies the initial seed fields (10−14 comoving Gauss) to the values observed in low-redshift galaxies (\\$1\\hbox\\{--\\}10\\, \\{\\rm \\mu G\\}\\$). The magnetic field topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are present in disc galaxies. Using two simple models for the energy distribution of relativistic electrons we predict the diffuse radio emission of 280 clusters with a baryonic mass resolution of \\$1.1\\times 10^\\{7\\}\\, \\{\\rm M\_\\{\\odot \\}\\}\\$, and generate mock observations for Very Large Array (VLA), Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR), Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), and Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our simulated clusters show extended radio emission, whose detectability correlates with their virial mass. We reproduce the observed scaling relations between total radio power and X-ray emission, M500, and the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Y500 parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.}",

We measure this correction using data from N-body simulations and demonstrate that it can boost power in the two-halo term by a factor of ∼2 at scales \\$k\\sim 0.7\\, h\\mathrm\\{Mpc\\}^\\{-1\\}\\$, with the exact magnitude of the boost determined by the specific pair of fields in the two-point function. How this translates to the full power spectrum depends on the relative strength of the one-halo term, which can mask the importance of this correction to a greater or lesser degree, again depending on the fields. Generally, we find that our correction is more important for signals that arise from lower mass haloes. When comparing our calculation to simulated data, we find that the underprediction of power in the transition region between the two- and one-halo terms, which typically plagues halo-model calculations, is almost completely eliminated when including the full non-linear halo bias. We show improved results for the autospectra and cross-spectra of galaxies, haloes, and matter. In the specific case of matter–matter or matter–halo power, we note that a large fraction of the improvement comes from the non-linear biasing between low- and high-mass haloes. We envisage our model being useful in the analytical modelling of cross-correlation signals. Our non-linear bias halo-model code is available at https://github.com/alexander-mead/BNL.}",

This shear–ellipticity correlation can mimic a cosmological weak lensing signal, and is potentially the limiting physical systematic effect for cosmology with future high-precision weak lensing surveys. We find that, if uncorrected, the shear–ellipticity correlation could contribute up to 10 per cent of the weak lensing signal on scales up to 20 arcmin, for lensing surveys with a median depth zm= 1. The most massive foreground galaxies are expected to cause the largest correlations, a result also seen in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that the redshift dependence of the effect is proportional to the lensing efficiency of the foreground, and this offers prospects for removal to high precision, although with some model dependence. The contamination is characterized by a weakly negative B mode, which can be used as a diagnostic of systematic errors. We also provide more accurate predictions for a second potential source of error, the intrinsic alignment of nearby galaxies. This source of contamination is less important, however, as it can be easily removed with distance information.}",

title = {Tidal alignment of galaxies},
journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {We develop an analytic model for galaxy intrinsic alignments   (IA) based on the theory of tidal alignment. We calculate all   relevant nonlinear corrections at one-loop order, including effects   from nonlinear density evolution, galaxy biasing, and source density   weighting. Contributions from density weighting are found to be   particularly important and lead to bias dependence of the IA   amplitude, even on large scales. This effect may be responsible for   much of the luminosity dependence in IA observations. The increase   in IA amplitude for more highly biased galaxies reflects their   locations in regions with large tidal fields. We also consider the   impact of smoothing the tidal field on halo scales. We compare the   performance of this consistent nonlinear model in describing the   observed alignment of luminous red galaxies with the linear model as   well as the frequently used “nonlinear alignment model,” finding a   significant improvement on small and intermediate scales. We also   show that the cross-correlation between density and IA (the “GI”   term) can be effectively separated into source alignment and source   clustering, and we accurately model the observed alignment down to   the one-halo regime using the tidal field from the fully nonlinear   halo-matter cross correlation. Inside the one-halo regime, the   average alignment of galaxies with density tracers no longer follows   the tidal alignment prediction, likely reflecting nonlinear   processes that must be considered when modeling IA on these   scales. Finally, we discuss tidal alignment in the context of cosmic   shear measurements.}

    abstract = "{Intrinsic alignment (IA) of source galaxies is one of the major astrophysical systematics for weak lensing surveys. Several IA models have been proposed and their impact on cosmological constraints has been examined using the Fisher information matrix in conjunction with approximate, Gaussian covariances. This paper presents the first forecasts of the impact of IA on cosmic shear measurements for future surveys using simulated likelihood analyses and covariances that include higher order moments of the density field. We consider a range of possible IA scenarios and test mitigation schemes which parametrize IA by the fraction of red galaxies, normalization, luminosity and redshift dependence of the IA signal. Compared to previous studies, we find smaller biases in time-dependent dark energy models if IA is ignored in the analysis. The amplitude and significance of these biases vary as a function of survey properties (depth, statistical uncertainties), luminosity function and IA scenario. Due to its small statistical errors and relatively shallow depth, Euclid is significantly impacted by IA. Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) benefit from increased survey depth, while larger statistical errors for Dark Energy Survey (DES) decrease IA's relative impact on cosmological parameters. The proposed IA mitigation scheme removes parameter biases for DES, LSST and WFIRST even if the shape of the IA power spectrum is only poorly known; successful IA mitigation for Euclid requires more prior information. We explore several alternative IA mitigation strategies for Euclid; in the absence of alignment of blue galaxies we recommend the exclusion of red (IA-contaminated) galaxies in cosmic shear analyses.}",
