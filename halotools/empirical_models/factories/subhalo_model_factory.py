class SubhaloModelFactory(ModelFactory):
    """ Class used to build models of the galaxy-halo connection 
    in which galaxies live at the centers of subhalos. 

    See :ref:`subhalo_modeling_tutorial0` for an in-depth description 
    of how to build subhalo-based models, demonstrated by a 
    sequence of increasingly complex examples. 
    If you do not wish to build your own model but want to use one 
    provided by Halotools, 
    instead see `~halotools.empirical_models.PrebuiltSubhaloModelFactory`. 

    The arguments passed to the `SubhaloModelFactory` constructor determine 
    the features of the model that are returned by the factory. This works in one of two ways, 
    both of which have explicit examples provided below. 

    1. Building a new model from scratch. 

    You can build a model from scratch by passing in a sequence of 
    ``model_features``, each of which are instances of component models. 
    The factory then composes these independently-defined 
    components into a composite model. 

    2. Building a new model from an existing model. 

    It is also possible to add/swap new features to a previously built composite model instance, 
    allowing you to create new models from existing ones. To do this, you pass in 
    a ``baseline_model_instance`` and any set of ``model_features``. 
    Any ``model_feature`` keyword that matches a feature name of the ``baseline_model_instance`` 
    will replace that feature in the ``baseline_model_instance``; 
    all other ``model_features`` that you pass in will augment 
    the ``baseline_model_instance`` with new behavior. 

    Regardless what set of features you use to build your model, 
    the returned object can be used to directly populate a halo catalog  
    with mock galaxies using the 
    `~halotools.empirical_models.SubhaloModelFactory.populate_mock` method, 
    as shown in the example below.

    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        """
        Parameters
        ------------------------------------

        *model_features : sequence of keyword arguments, optional 
            Each keyword you use will be interpreted as the name 
            of a feature in the composite model, 
            e.g. 'stellar_mass' or 'star_formation_rate'; 
            the value bound to each keyword must be an instance of a 
            component model governing the behavior of that feature. 
            See the examples section below. 

        baseline_model_instance : `SubhaloModelFactory` instance, optional 
            If passed to the constructor, the ``model_dictionary`` bound to the 
            ``baseline_model_instance`` will be treated as the baseline dictionary. 
            Any additional keyword arguments passed to the constructor that appear 
            in the baseline dictionary will be treated as model features that replace 
            the corresponding component model in the baseline dictionary. Any  
            model features passed to the constructor that do not 
            appear in the baseline dictionary will be treated as new features that 
            augment the baseline model with new behavior. See the examples section below. 

        model_feature_calling_sequence : list, optional
            Determines the order in which your component features  
            will be called during mock population. 

            Some component models may have explicit dependence upon 
            the value of some other galaxy property being modeled. 
            In such a case, you must pass a ``model_feature_calling_sequence`` list, 
            ordered in the desired calling sequence. 

            A classic example is if the stellar-to-halo-mass relation 
            has explicit dependence on the star formation rate of the galaxy 
            (active or quiescent). For this example, the
            ``model_feature_calling_sequence`` would be 
            model_feature_calling_sequence = ['sfr_designation', 'stellar_mass', ...]. 

            Default behavior is to assume that no model feature  
            has explicit dependence upon any other, in which case the component 
            models appearing in the ``model_features`` keyword arguments 
            will be called in random order, giving primacy to the potential presence 
            of `stellar_mass` and/or `luminosity` features. 

        galaxy_selection_func : function object, optional  
            Function object that imposes a cut on the mock galaxies. 
            Function should take a length-k Astropy table as a single positional argument, 
            and return a length-k numpy boolean array that will be 
            treated as a mask over the rows of the table. If not None, 
            the mask defined by ``galaxy_selection_func`` will be applied to the 
            ``galaxy_table`` after the table is generated by the `populate_mock` method. 
            Default is None.  

        halo_selection_func : function object, optional   
            Function object used to place a cut on the input ``table``. 
            If the ``halo_selection_func`` keyword argument is passed, 
            the input to the function must be a single positional argument storing a 
            length-N structured numpy array or Astropy table; 
            the function output must be a length-N boolean array that will be used as a mask. 
            Halos that are masked will be entirely neglected during mock population.

        Examples 
        ------------------------------------
        As described above, there are two different ways to build models using the 
        `SubhaloModelFactory`. Here we give demonstrations of each in turn. 

        In the first example we'll show how to build a model from scratch using 
        the ``model_features`` option. 
        We'll build a composite model from two component models: one modeling stellar mass, 
        one modeling star formation rate designation. We will use the 
        `~halotools.empirical_models.Behroozi10SmHm` class to model stellar mass, 
        and the `~halotools.empirical_models.BinaryGalpropInterpolModel` class to model 
        whether galaxies are quiescent or star-forming. See the docstrings of these 
        classes for more information about their behavior. 

        >>> from halotools.empirical_models import Behroozi10SmHm
        >>> stellar_mass_model = Behroozi10SmHm(redshift = 0.5)

        >>> from halotools.empirical_models import BinaryGalpropInterpolModel
        >>> sfr_model = BinaryGalpropInterpolModel(galprop_name = 'quiescent_designation', galprop_abscissa = [12, 15], galprop_ordinates = [0.25, 0.75])

        At this point we have two component model instances, ``stellar_mass_model`` and 
        ``sfr_model``. The following call to the factory uses the ``model_features`` option 
        described above:

        >>> model_instance = SubhaloModelFactory(stellar_mass = stellar_mass_model, sfr = sfr_model)

        The feature names we have chosen are 'stellar_mass' and 'sfr', and to each feature 
        we have attached a component model instance. 
        
        In this particular example the assignment of stellar mass and SFR-designation 
        are entirely independent, and so no other arguments are necessary. However, if you are 
        building a model in which one or more of your components has explicit dependence on 
        some other feature, then you can use the ``model_feature_calling_sequence`` argument; 
        this is a list of the feature names whose order determines the sequence in which 
        the components will be called during mock population:

        >>> model_instance = SubhaloModelFactory(stellar_mass = stellar_mass_model, sfr = sfr_model, model_feature_calling_sequence = ['stellar_mass', 'sfr'])

        For more details about this optional argument, 
        see :ref:`model_feature_calling_sequence_mechanism`. 

        Whatever features your composite model has, you can use the `~SubhaloModelFactory.populate_mock` method 
        to create Monte Carlo realization of the model by populating any dark matter halo catalog 
        in your cache directory:

        >>> from halotools.sim_manager import CachedHaloCatalog 
        >>> halocat = CachedHaloCatalog(simname = 'bolshoi', redshift = 0.5) # doctest: +SKIP
        >>> model_instance.populate_mock(halocat) # doctest: +SKIP

        Your ``model_instance`` now has a ``mock`` attribute storing a synthetic galaxy 
        population. See the `~SubhaloModelFactory.populate_mock` docstring for details. 

        There also convenience functions for estimating the clustering signal predicted by the model. 
        For example, the following method repeatedly populates the Bolshoi simulation with 
        galaxies, computes the 3-d galaxy clustering signal of each mock, computes the median 
        clustering signal in each bin, and returns the result:

        >>> r, xi = model_instance.compute_average_galaxy_clustering(num_iterations = 5, simname = 'bolshoi', redshift = 0.5) # doctest: +SKIP

        In this next example we'll show how to build a new model from an existing one 
        using the ``baseline_model_instance`` option. We will start from  
        the composite model built in Example 1 above. Here we'll build a 
        new model which is identical the ``model_instance`` above, 
        only we instead use 
        the `Moster13SmHm` class to model stellar mass. 

        >>> from halotools.empirical_models import Moster13SmHm
        >>> moster_model = Moster13SmHm(redshift = 0.5)
        >>> new_model_instance = SubhaloModelFactory(stellar_mass = moster_model, baseline_model_instance = model_instance)

        The ``model_feature_calling_sequence`` works in the same way as it did in Example 1. 

        >>> new_model_instance = SubhaloModelFactory(stellar_mass = moster_model, baseline_model_instance = model_instance, model_feature_calling_sequence = ['stellar_mass', 'sfr'])

        which attributes will be inherited by the composite model. If any component models did not 
        implement the ``_attrs_to_inherit``, an empty list is forcibly added to the component model.

        The behavior of the methods bound to the composite model are decorated versions 
        of the methods defined in the component models. The decoration is done with 
        `update_param_dict_decorator`. For each function that gets bound to the 
        composite model, what this decorator does is search the param_dict of the 
        component_model associated with the function, and update all matching keys 
        in that param_dict with the param_dict of the composite. 
        This way, all the user needs to do is make changes to the composite model 
        param_dict. Then, when calling any method of the composite model, 
        the changed values of the param_dict automatically propagate down 
        to the component model before calling upon its behavior.

            Either an instance of `~halotools.sim_manager.CachedHaloCatalog` 
            or `~halotools.sim_manager.UserSuppliedHaloCatalog`. 

       Examples 
        ----------
        Here we'll use a pre-built model to demonstrate basic usage. 
        The syntax shown below is the same for all composite models, 
        whether they are pre-built by Halotools or built by you with `SubhaloModelFactory`. 

        >>> from halotools.empirical_models import PrebuiltSubhaloModelFactory
        >>> model_instance = PrebuiltSubhaloModelFactory('behroozi10')

        Here we will use a fake simulation, but you can populate mocks 
        using any instance of `~halotools.sim_manager.CachedHaloCatalog` or 
        `~halotools.sim_manager.UserSuppliedHaloCatalog`. 

        >>> from halotools.sim_manager import FakeSim
        >>> halocat = FakeSim()
        >>> model_instance.populate_mock(halocat)

        Your ``model_instance`` now has a ``mock`` attribute bound to it. 
        You can call the `~halotools.empirical_models.SubhaloMockFactory.populate` 
        method bound to the ``mock``, which will repopulate the halo catalog 
        with a new Monte Carlo realization of the model. 

        >>> model_instance.mock.populate()

        If you want to change the behavior of your model, just change the 
        values stored in the ``param_dict``. Differences in the parameter values 
        will change the behavior of the mock-population. 

        >>> model_instance.param_dict['scatter_model_param1'] = 0.25
        >>> model_instance.mock.populate()
