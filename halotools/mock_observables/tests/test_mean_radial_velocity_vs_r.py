    """ This function tests that the 
    `~halotools.mock_observables.mean_radial_velocity_vs_r` function returns correct 
    results for a controlled distribution of points whose mean radial velocity 
    is analytically calculable. 

    For this test, the configuration is two tight localizations of points, 
    the first at (0.05, 0.05, 0.05), the second at (0.95, 0.95, 0.95). 
    The first set of points is moving at (+50, +50, +50); 
    the second set of points is moving at (-50, -50, -50).

    So in this configuration, when PBCs are operative 
    the two sets of points are each moving towards each other, 
    so the radial component of the relative velocity 
    should be +100*sqrt(3) for cross-correlations in the radial separation bin containing the 
    pair of points. For any separation bin containing only 
    one set or the other, the auto-correlations should be 0 because each set of 
    points moves coherently. 
    When PBCs are turned off, the function should return zero as the points 
    are too distant to find pairs. 

    These tests will be applied with and without periodic boundary conditions. 
    The tests will also be run with the two point configurations passed in as 
    separate ``sample1`` and ``sample2`` distributions, as well as bundled 
    together into the same distribution.
