    """
    Function counts the number of points in ``sample2`` separated by a xy-distance
    *r* and z-distance *z* from each point in ``sample1``,
    where *r* and *z* are defined by the input ``proj_search_radius``
    and ``cylinder_half_length``, respectively.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1 : array_like
        Npts1 x 3 numpy array containing 3-D positions of points.
        See the :ref:`mock_obs_pos_formatting` documentation page, or the
        Examples section below, for instructions on how to transform
        your coordinate position arrays into the
        format accepted by the ``sample1`` and ``sample2`` arguments.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    sample2 : array_like
        Npts2 x 3 array containing 3-D positions of points. If this is None, an
        autocorrelation on sample1 will be done instead.

    proj_search_radius : array_like
        Length-Npts1 array defining the xy-distance around each point in ``sample1``
        to search for points in ``sample2``.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    cylinder_half_length : array_like
        Length-Npts1 array defining the z-distance around each point in ``sample1``
        to search for points in ``sample2``. Thus the *total* length of the cylinder
        placed around each point in ``sample1`` will be *twice* the corresponding
        value stored in the input ``cylinder_half_length``.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    period : array_like, optional
        Length-3 array defining the periodic boundary conditions.
        If only one number is specified, the enclosing volume is assumed to
        be a periodic cube (by far the most common case).
        If period is set to None, the default option,
        PBCs are set to infinity.

    verbose : Boolean, optional
        If True, print out information and progress.

    num_threads : int, optional
        Number of threads to use in calculation, where parallelization is performed
        using the python ``multiprocessing`` module. Default is 1 for a purely serial
        calculation, in which case a multiprocessing Pool object will
        never be instantiated. A string 'max' may be used to indicate that
        the pair counters should use all available cores on the machine.

    approx_cell1_size : array_like, optional
        Length-3 array serving as a guess for the optimal manner by how points
        will be apportioned into subvolumes of the simulation box.
        The optimum choice unavoidably depends on the specs of your machine.
        Default choice is to use Lbox/10 in each dimension,
        which will return reasonable result performance for most use-cases.
        Performance can vary sensitively with this parameter, so it is highly
        recommended that you experiment with this parameter when carrying out
        performance-critical calculations.

    approx_cell2_size : array_like, optional
        Analogous to ``approx_cell1_size``, but for sample2.  See comments for
        ``approx_cell1_size`` for details.

    return_indexes: bool, optional
        If true, return both counts and the indexes of the pairs.

    Returns
    -------
    num_pairs : array_like
        Numpy array of length Npts1 storing the numbers of points in ``sample2``
        inside the cylinder surrounding each point in ``sample1``.

    indexes : array_like, optional
        If ``return_indexes`` is true, return a structured array of length
        num_pairs with the indexes of the pairs. Column ``i1`` is the index in
        ``sample1`` at the center of the cylinder and column ``i2`` is the index
        in ``sample2`` that is contained in the cylinder.

    Examples
    --------
    For illustration purposes, we'll create some fake data and call the pair counter.

    >>> from halotools.sim_manager import FakeSim
    >>> halocat = FakeSim()

    In this first example, we'll demonstrate how to calculate the number of
    low-mass host halos are in cylinders of *fixed length* surrounding high-mass halos.

    >>> host_halo_mask = halocat.halo_table['halo_upid'] == -1
    >>> host_halos = halocat.halo_table[host_halo_mask]
    >>> high_mass_mask = host_halos['halo_mvir'] >= 5e13
    >>> high_mass_hosts = host_halos[high_mass_mask]
    >>> low_mass_mask = host_halos['halo_mvir'] <= 1e12
    >>> low_mass_hosts = host_halos[low_mass_mask]

    >>> x1, y1, z1 = high_mass_hosts['halo_x'], high_mass_hosts['halo_y'], high_mass_hosts['halo_z']
    >>> x2, y2, z2 = low_mass_hosts['halo_x'], low_mass_hosts['halo_y'], low_mass_hosts['halo_z']

    We transform our *x, y, z* points into the array shape used by the pair-counter by
    taking the transpose of the result of `numpy.vstack`. This boilerplate transformation
    is used throughout the `~halotools.mock_observables` sub-package:

    >>> sample1 = np.vstack([x1, y1, z1]).T
    >>> sample2 = np.vstack([x2, y2, z2]).T

    Now let's drop a cylinder of radius 200 kpc/h and half-length 250 kpc/h around
    each high-mass host halo, and for each high-mass host we'll count the number of
    low-mass halos falling within that cylinder:

    >>> period = halocat.Lbox
    >>> proj_search_radius, cylinder_half_length = 0.2, 0.25
    >>> result = counts_in_cylinders(sample1, sample2, proj_search_radius, cylinder_half_length, period=period)

    For example usage of the `~halotools.mock_observables.counts_in_cylinders` function
    on a realistic galaxy catalog that makes use of the variable search length feature,
    see the :ref:`calculating_counts_in_cells` tutorial.
