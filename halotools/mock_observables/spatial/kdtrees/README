This folder contains a kdtree object written in cython. It is a heavily modified version 
of the scipy.spatial.ckdtree object.

The code must be compiled. This is accomplished by typing into the terminal:
    python setup_ckdtree.py build_ext --inplace

The kdtree supports calculations with and without PBCs(Periodic Boundary Conditions). The 
PBCs must be axis aligned to the coordinate system of the points used to build the tree. 

The kdtree also has some functions wich support weighting of points for counting purposes.

Current available functions are:
    query -- accepts PBCs
    query_ball_point -- accepts PBCs
    query_ball_tree -- accepts PBCs
    query_ball_tree_wcounts --  accepts PBCs, and weights on other
    query_pairs -- accepts PBCs
    count_neighbors -- accepts PBCs
    wcount_neighbors -- like count_neighbors, but accepts weights for other and self and a
        function, w, defining how to handle weighted counts of the form w(w1,w2): return 
        double.  The default is return w1*w2.
    sparse_distance_matrix -- does not have support for PBCs because I can't think of a 
        use for it currently.
    
Note that a Minkowski p-norm of infinity is not supported currently. This wouldn't be too
hard to add, but I am lazy. In addition, I have only really tested and have a current use 
for p=2.
