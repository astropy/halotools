    r"""
    Calculate the number of weighted pairs with separations greater than
    or equal to :math:`r_{\perp}` and :math:`r_{\parallel}`, :math:`W(>r_{\perp},>r_{\parallel})`.

    :math:`r_{\perp}` and :math:`r_{\parallel}` are defined wrt the z-direction.

    The weight given to each pair is determined by the weights for a pair,
    :math:`w_1`, :math:`w_2`, and a user-specified "weighting function", indicated
    by the ``wfunc`` parameter, :math:`f(w_1,w_2)`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1 : array_like
        Numpy array of shape (Npts1, 3) containing 3-D positions of points.
        See the :ref:`mock_obs_pos_formatting` documentation page, or the
        Examples section below, for instructions on how to transform
        your coordinate position arrays into the
        format accepted by the ``sample1`` and ``sample2`` arguments.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    sample2 : array_like, optional
        Numpy array of shape (Npts2, 3) containing 3-D positions of points.
        Should be identical to sample1 for cases of auto-sample pair counts.

    rp_bins : array_like
        array of boundaries defining the radial bins perpendicular to the LOS in which
        pairs are counted.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    pi_bins : array_like
        array of boundaries defining the p radial bins parallel to the LOS in which
        pairs are counted.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    period : array_like, optional
        Length-3 sequence defining the periodic boundary conditions
        in each dimension. If you instead provide a single scalar, Lbox,
        period is assumed to be the same in all Cartesian directions.

    weights1 : array_like, optional
        Either a 1-D array of length *N1*, or a 2-D array of length *N1* x *N_weights*,
        containing the weights used for the weighted pair counts. If this parameter is
        None, the weights are set to np.ones(*(N1,N_weights)*).

    weights2 : array_like, optional
        Either a 1-D array of length *N1*, or a 2-D array of length *N1* x *N_weights*,
        containing the weights used for the weighted pair counts. If this parameter is
        None, the weights are set to np.ones(*(N1,N_weights)*).

    wfunc : int, optional
        weighting function integer ID. Each weighting function requires a specific
        number of weights per point, *N_weights*.  See the Notes for a description of
        available weighting functions.

    verbose : Boolean, optional
        If True, print out information and progress.

    num_threads : int, optional
        Number of threads to use in calculation, where parallelization is performed
        using the python ``multiprocessing`` module. Default is 1 for a purely serial
        calculation, in which case a multiprocessing Pool object will
        never be instantiated. A string 'max' may be used to indicate that
        the pair counters should use all available cores on the machine.

    approx_cell1_size : array_like, optional
        Length-3 array serving as a guess for the optimal manner by how points
        will be apportioned into subvolumes of the simulation box.
        The optimum choice unavoidably depends on the specs of your machine.
        Default choice is to use Lbox/10 in each dimension,
        which will return reasonable result performance for most use-cases.
        Performance can vary sensitively with this parameter, so it is highly
        recommended that you experiment with this parameter when carrying out
        performance-critical calculations.

    approx_cell2_size : array_like, optional
        Analogous to ``approx_cell1_size``, but for sample2.  See comments for
        ``approx_cell1_size`` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    wN_pairs : numpy.array
        Numpy array of shape (Nrp_bins, Nrpi_bins) containing the weighted number counts of pairs

    N_pairs : numpy.array
        Numpy array of shape (Nrp_bins, Nrpi_bins) containing the number counts of pairs
