    r"""
    Calculate the number of weighted pairs with separations greater than or equal to r, :math:`W(>r)`,
    where the weight of each pair is given by soe function of a
    N-d array stored in each input weight and the separation vector of the pair.

    Note that if sample1 == sample2 that the `positional_marked_npairs` function double-counts pairs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1 : array_like
        Numpy array of shape (Npts1, 3) containing 3-D positions of points.
        See the :ref:`mock_obs_pos_formatting` documentation page, or the
        Examples section below, for instructions on how to transform
        your coordinate position arrays into the
        format accepted by the ``sample1`` and ``sample2`` arguments.
        Length units are comoving and assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    sample2 : array_like
        Numpy array of shape (Npts2, 3) containing 3-D positions of points.
        Should be identical to sample1 for cases of auto-sample pair counts.

    rbins : array_like
        numpy array of length *Nrbins+1* defining the boundaries of bins in which
        pairs are counted.

    period : array_like, optional
        Length-3 sequence defining the periodic boundary conditions
        in each dimension. If you instead provide a single scalar, Lbox,
        period is assumed to be the same in all Cartesian directions.

    weights1 : array_like, optional
        Either a 1-D array of length *N1*, or a 2-D array of length *N1* x *N_weights1*,
        containing the weights used for the weighted pair counts. If this parameter is
        None, the weights are set to np.ones(*(N1, N_weights1)*).

    weights2 : array_like, optional
        Either a 1-D array of length *N2*, or a 2-D array of length *N2* x *N_weights2*,
        containing the weights used for the weighted pair counts. If this parameter is
        None, the weights are set to np.ones(*(N2, N_weights2)*).

    weight_func_id : int, optional
        weighting function integer ID. Each weighting function requires a specific
        number of weights per point, *N_weights1*, *N_weights2*.  See the Notes for a description of
        available weighting functions.

    verbose : Boolean, optional
        If True, print out information and progress.

    num_threads : int, optional
        Number of threads to use in calculation, where parallelization is performed
        using the python ``multiprocessing`` module. Default is 1 for a purely serial
        calculation, in which case a multiprocessing Pool object will
        never be instantiated. A string 'max' may be used to indicate that
        the pair counters should use all available cores on the machine.

    approx_cell1_size : array_like, optional
        Length-3 array serving as a guess for the optimal manner by how points
        will be apportioned into subvolumes of the simulation box.
        The optimum choice unavoidably depends on the specs of your machine.
        Default choice is to use Lbox/10 in each dimension,
        which will return reasonable result performance for most use-cases.
        Performance can vary sensitively with this parameter, so it is highly
        recommended that you experiment with this parameter when carrying out
        performance-critical calculations.

    approx_cell2_size : array_like, optional
        Analogous to ``approx_cell1_size``, but for sample2.  See comments for
        ``approx_cell1_size`` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    wN_pairs : numpy.array
        Numpy array of shape (Nrbins, ) containing the weighted number counts of pairs

    N_pairs : numpy.array
        Numpy array of shape (Nrbins, ) containing the number counts of pairs

    Notes
    -----
    There are multiple marking functions available.  In general, each requires a different
    number of marks per point, N_marks.  The marking function gets passed three vectors
    per pair: :math:`w_1` and :math:`w_2` of length N_marks, and :math:`s_{12}`,
    the length 3 vector between points 1 and 2. Each function returns a float.
    The available marking functions, ``weight_func_id`` and the associated integer ID numbers are:

    #. position-shape dot product (N_marks = 4,1)
        .. math::
            \begin{array}{ll}
            \cos\theta = (w_1[1]\times s_{12}[0] + w_1[2]\times s_{12}[1] + w_1[3]\times s_{12}[2])/\sqrt{|s_{12}|} \\
            f(w_1,w_2) = w_1[0]\times w_2[0]\times \cos\theta
            \end{array}

    #. gamma plus (N_marks = 4,1)
        .. math::
            \begin{array}{ll}
            \cos\theta = (w_1[1]\times s_{12}[0] + w_1[2]\times s_{12}[1] + w_1[3]\times s_{12}[2])/\sqrt{|s_{12}|} \\
            \theta = \cos^{-1}(\cos\theta) \\
            f(w_1,w_2) = w_1[0]\times w_2[0]\times \cos(2\theta)
            \end{array}

    #. gamma minus (N_marks = 4,1)
        .. math::
            \begin{array}{ll}
            \cos\theta = (w_1[1]\times s_{12}[0] + w_1[2]\times s_{12}[1] + w_1[3]\times s_{12}[2])/\sqrt{|s_{12}|} \\
            \theta = \cos^{-1}(\cos\theta) \\
            f(w_1,w_2) = w_1[0]\times w_2[0]\times \sin(2\theta)
            \end{array}

    #. position-shape dot product squared (N_marks = 4,1)
        .. math::
            \begin{array}{ll}
            \cos\theta = (w_1[1]\times s_{12}[0] + w_1[2]\times s_{12}[1] + w_1[3]\times s_{12}[2])/\sqrt{|s_{12}|} \\
            f(w_1,w_2) = w_1[0]\times w_2[0]\times \cos\theta\cos\theta
            \end{array}

    Examples
    --------
    For demonstration purposes we create randomly distributed sets of points within a
    periodic unit cube, using random weights.

    >>> Npts1, Npts2, Lbox = 1000, 1000, 250.
    >>> period = [Lbox, Lbox, Lbox]
    >>> rbins = np.logspace(-1, 1.5, 15)

    >>> x1 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts1)
    >>> y1 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts1)
    >>> z1 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts1)
    >>> x2 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts2)
    >>> y2 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts2)
    >>> z2 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts2)

    We transform our *x, y, z* points into the array shape used by the pair-counter by
    taking the transpose of the result of `numpy.vstack`. This boilerplate transformation
    is used throughout the `~halotools.mock_observables` sub-package:

    >>> sample1 = np.vstack([x1, y1, z1]).T
    >>> sample2 = np.vstack([x2, y2, z2]).T

    We create a set of random weights:

    >>> weights1 = np.random.random((Npts1, 4))
    >>> weights2 = np.random.random((Npts2, 1))

    The weighted counts are calculated by:

    >>> weighted_counts, counts = positional_marked_npairs_3d(sample1, sample2, rbins, period=period, weights1=weights1, weights2=weights2, weight_func_id=1)
