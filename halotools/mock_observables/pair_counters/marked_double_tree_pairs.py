    weighted real-space pair counter.
    
    Count the weighted number of pairs (x1,x2) that can be formed, with x1 drawn from 
    data1 and x2 drawn from data2, and where distance(x1, x2) <= rbins[i].  Weighted 
    counts are calculated as wfunc(w1,w2,r1,r2)
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data1 : array_like
        N1 by 3 numpy array of 3-dimensional positions. Should be between zero and 
        period. This cython implementation requires data1.ndim==2.
            
    data2 : array_like
        N2 by 3 numpy array of 3-dimensional positions. Should be between zero and 
        period. This cython implementation requires data2.ndim==2.
            
    rbins : array_like
        numpy array of boundaries defining the bins in which pairs are counted. 
    
    period : array_like, optional
        length k array defining axis-aligned periodic boundary conditions. If only 
        one number, Lbox, is specified, period is assumed to be np.array([Lbox]*k).
        If none, PBCs are set to infinity.  If True, period is set to be Lbox
    
    weights1 : array_like, optional
        Either a 1-d array of length N1, or a 2-d array of length N1 x N_weights, 
        containing weights used for weighted pair counts
        
    weights2 : array_like, optional
        Either a 1-d array of length N2, or a 2-d array of length N2 x N_weights, 
        containing weights used for weighted pair counts
        
    wfunc : int, optional
        weighting function ID.
    
    verbose : Boolean, optional
        If True, print out information and progress.
    
    num_threads : int, optional
        number of 'threads' to use in the pair counting.  if set to 'max', use all 
        available cores.  num_threads=0 is the default.
    
    approx_cell1_size : array_like, optional 
        Length-3 array serving as a guess for the optimal manner by which 
        the `~halotools.mock_observables.pair_counters.FlatRectanguloidDoubleTree` 
        will apportion the ``data`` points into subvolumes of the simulation box. 
        The optimum choice unavoidably depends on the specs of your machine. 
        Default choice is to use 1/10 of the box size in each dimension, 
        which will return reasonable result performance for most use-cases. 
        Performance can vary sensitively with this parameter, so it is highly 
        recommended that you experiment with this parameter when carrying out  
        performance-critical calculations. 
        
    approx_cell2_size : array_like, optional 
        See comments for ``approx_cell1_size``. 
        
    Returns
    -------
    N_pairs : array of length len(rbins)
        number counts of pairs
