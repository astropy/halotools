##Mock Observables

This submodule contains a class of objects and functions to calculate observational 
statistics on mock galaxy catalogs.

###Available Calculations and Submodules
* two_point_functions.py, contains functions to calculate to point statistis like the two 
point correlation function
* make_redshift_survey.py, contains methods to construct mock redshift surveys
* observables.py, contains functions to calculate miscellaneous statistics.
* isolation_criteria.py, in development
* pair_counters, submodule to preform pair counts
* spatial, submodule for spatial and geometric calculations
* group_fuinders, in development

###Notes
This submodule is under active development, and things are changing rapidly and often. 
Expect APIs and available calculations to change often.
