    Determine whether a set of points, ``sample1``, is isolated, i.e. does not have a 
    neighbor in ``sample2`` within an user specified cylindrical volume centered at each 
    point in ``sample1``.

    See also :ref:`galaxy_catalog_analysis_tutorial10` for example usage on a 
    mock galaxy catalog. 
  
    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1 : array_like
        *Npts1 x 3* numpy array containing 3-D positions of points.
        
        See the :ref:`mock_obs_pos_formatting` documentation page, or the 
        Examples section below, for instructions on how to transform 
        your coordinate position arrays into the 
        format accepted by the ``sample1`` and ``sample2`` arguments.   
        
        Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools. 
        
    sample2 : array_like
        *Npts2 x 3* numpy array containing 3-D positions of points.
    
    rp_max : array_like
        radius of the cylinder to search for neighbors around galaxies in ``sample1``.
        If a single float is given, ``rp_max`` is assumed to be the same for each galaxy in
        ``sample1``. You may optionally pass in an array of length *Npts1*, in which case 
        each point in ``sample1`` will have its own individual neighbor-search projected radius. 

        Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.

    pi_max : array_like
        Half-length of cylinder to search for neighbors around galaxies in ``sample1``.
        If a single float is given, ``pi_max`` is assumed to be the same for each galaxy in
        ``sample1``. You may optionally pass in an array of length *Npts1*, in which case 
        each point in ``sample1`` will have its own individual neighbor-search cylinder half-length. 

        Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.
    
    period : array_like, optional
        Length-3 sequence defining the periodic boundary conditions 
        in each dimension. If you instead provide a single scalar, Lbox, 
        period is assumed to be the same in all Cartesian directions. 
        
        Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools. 
    
    num_threads : int, optional
        Number of threads to use in calculation, where parallelization is performed 
        using the python ``multiprocessing`` module. Default is 1 for a purely serial 
        calculation, in which case a multiprocessing Pool object will 
        never be instantiated. A string 'max' may be used to indicate that 
        the pair counters should use all available cores on the machine.
        
    approx_cell1_size : array_like, optional 
        Length-3 array serving as a guess for the optimal manner by how points 
        will be apportioned into subvolumes of the simulation box. 
        The optimum choice unavoidably depends on the specs of your machine. 
        Default choice is to use Lbox/10 in each dimension, 
        which will return reasonable result performance for most use-cases. 
        Performance can vary sensitively with this parameter, so it is highly 
        recommended that you experiment with this parameter when carrying out  
        performance-critical calculations. 

    approx_cell2_size : array_like, optional 
        Analogous to ``approx_cell1_size``, but for sample2.  See comments for 
        ``approx_cell1_size`` for details. 
        
    Returns
    -------
    is_isolated : numpy.array
        array of booleans indicating if each point in `sample1` is isolated.
        
    Examples
    --------
    First we create a randomly distributed set of points ``sample1``, together with 
    random z-velocities for those points. We will then place ``sample1`` into redshift-space 
    using the `~halotools.mock_observables.return_xyz_formatted_array` function. 
    We will use the `~halotools.mock_observables.cylindrical_isolation` function to determine 
    which points in ``sample1`` have zero neighbors inside a cylinder of radius 
    ``rp_max`` and half-length ``pi_max``. 
    
    >>> Npts = 1000
    >>> Lbox = 250.0
    >>> period = Lbox
    >>> x = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> y = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> z = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> vz = np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = 100, size = Npts)
    
    We place our points into redshift-space, formatting the result into the 
    appropriately shaped array used throughout the `~halotools.mock_observables` sub-package:
    
    >>> from halotools.mock_observables import return_xyz_formatted_array
    >>> sample1 = return_xyz_formatted_array(x, y, z, period = Lbox, velocity = vz, velocity_distortion_dimension='z')
    
    Now we will call `cylindrical_isolation` with ``sample2`` set to ``sample1``, applying a 
    projected separation cut of 500 kpc/h, and a line-of-sight velocity cut of 750 km/s. 
    Note that Halotools assumes *h=1* throughout the package, and that 
    all Halotools length-units are in Mpc/h. 
    
    >>> rp_max = 0.5 # 500 kpc/h cut in perpendicular direction

    Since *h=1* implies :math:`H_{0} = 100` km/s/Mpc, our 750 km/s velocity criteria 
    gets transformed into a z-dimension length criteria as:
    
    >>> H0 = 100.0
    >>> pi_max = 750./H0
    >>> is_isolated = cylindrical_isolation(sample1, sample1, rp_max, pi_max, period=period)
    
    In the next example that follows, ``sample2`` will be a different set of points 
    from ``sample1``, so we will determine which points in ``sample1`` 
    have a neighbor in ``sample2`` located inside a cylinder of radius ``rp_max`` 
    and half-length ``pi_max``. 
    
    >>> x2 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> y2 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> z2 = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> vz2 = np.random.normal(loc = 0, scale = 100, size = Npts)
    >>> sample2 = return_xyz_formatted_array(x2, y2, z2, period = Lbox, velocity = vz2, velocity_distortion_dimension='z')
    
    >>> is_isolated = cylindrical_isolation(sample1, sample2, rp_max, pi_max, period=period)
    
    Notes
    -----
    There is one edge-case of all the isolation criteria functions worthy of special mention. 
    Suppose there exists a point *p* in ``sample1`` with the exact same spatial coordinates 
    as one or more points in ``sample2``. The matching point(s) in ``sample2`` will **not** 
    be considered neighbors of *p*.
