    Determine whether a set of points, ``sample1``, is isolated, i.e. does not have a 
    neighbor in ``sample2`` within an user specified spherical volume centered at each 
    point in ``sample1``, where various additional conditions may be applied to judge 
    whether a matching point is considered to be a neighbor. 
    
    For example, `conditional_spherical_isolation` can be used to identify galaxies as 
    isolated if no other galaxy with a greater stellar mass lies within 500 kpc. 
    Different additional criteria can be built up from different combinations of 
    input ``marks1``, ``marks2`` and ``cond_func``.
    
    See the Examples section for further details.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    sample1 : array_like
        Npts1 x 3 numpy array containing 3-D positions of points.
        See the :ref:`mock_obs_pos_formatting` documentation page, or the 
        Examples section below, for instructions on how to transform 
        your coordinate position arrays into the 
        format accepted by the ``sample1`` and ``sample2`` arguments.   
        Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools. 
    
    sample2 : array_like
        Npts2 x 3 numpy array containing 3-D positions of points.
    
    r_max : array_like
        radius of spheres to search for neighbors around galaxies in ``sample1``.
        If a single float is given, ``r_max`` is assumed to be the same for each galaxy in
        ``sample1``. Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools.
    
    marks1 : array_like
        len(sample1) x N_marks array of marks.  The supplied marks array must have the 
        appropiate shape for the chosen ``cond_func`` (see Notes for requirements).  If 
        this parameter is not specified, it is set 
        to numpy.ones((len(sample1), N_marks)).
    
    marks2 : array_like
        len(sample2) x N_marks array of marks.  The supplied marks array must have the 
        appropiate shape for the chosen ``cond_func`` (see Notes for requirements).  If 
        this parameter is not specified, it is set 
        to numpy.ones((len(sample1), N_marks)).
    
    cond_func : int
        Integer ID indicating which conditional function should be used.  See notes for a 
        list of available conditional functions.
        
    period : array_like, optional
        Length-3 sequence defining the periodic boundary conditions 
        in each dimension. If you instead provide a single scalar, Lbox, 
        period is assumed to be the same in all Cartesian directions. 
        Length units assumed to be in Mpc/h, here and throughout Halotools. 
    
    num_threads : int, optional
        Number of threads to use in calculation, where parallelization is performed 
        using the python ``multiprocessing`` module. Default is 1 for a purely 
        calculation, in which case a multiprocessing Pool object will 
        never be instantiated. A string 'max' may be used to indicate that 
        the pair counters should use all available cores on the machine.
        
    approx_cell1_size : array_like, optional 
        Length-3 array serving as a guess for the optimal manner by how points 
        will be apportioned into subvolumes of the simulation box. 
        The optimum choice unavoidably depends on the specs of your machine. 
        Default choice is to use Lbox/10 in each dimension, 
        which will return reasonable result performance for most use-cases. 
        Performance can vary sensitively with this parameter, so it is highly 
        recommended that you experiment with this parameter when carrying out  
        performance-critical calculations. 
    
    approx_cell2_size : array_like, optional 
        Analogous to ``approx_cell1_size``, but for ``sample2``.  See comments for 
        ``approx_cell1_size`` for details. 
        
    Returns
    -------
    is_isolated : numpy.array
        array of booleans indicating if each point in `sample1` is isolated.
    
    Notes
    -----
    The `~halotools.mock_observables.conditional_spherical_isolation` function only differs 
    from the `~halotools.mock_observables.spherical_isolation` function in the treatment of 
    the input marks. In order for a point *p2* in ``sample2`` with mark :math:`w_{2}` 
    to be considered a neighbor of a point *p1* in ``sample1`` with mark :math:`w_{1}`, 
    two following conditions must be met:
    
    #. *p2* must lie within a distance ``r_max`` of *p1*, and 
    
    #. the input conditional marking function :math:`f(w_{1}, w_{2})` must return *True*.  
    
    There are multiple conditional functions available.  In general, each requires a 
    different number of marks per point, N_marks.  The conditional function gets passed 
    two arrays per pair, *w1* and *w2*, of length N_marks and return a boolean.  
    You can pass in more than one piece of information about each point by choosing a 
    the input ``marks`` arrays to be multi-dimensional of shape (N_points, N_marks). 
    
    The available marking functions, ``cond_func`` and the associated integer 
    ID numbers are:

    Examples
    --------
    In this first example, we will show how to calculate the following notion of 
    galaxy isolation. A galaxy is isolated if there are zero other *more massive* 
    galaxies within 5 Mpc. 
    
    First we create a random distribution of points inside the box: 
    
    >>> Npts = 1000
    >>> Lbox = 250.
    >>> x = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> y = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    >>> z = np.random.uniform(0, Lbox, Npts)
    
    We transform our *x, y, z* points into the array shape used by the pair-counter by 
    taking the transpose of the result of `numpy.vstack`. This boilerplate transformation 
    is used throughout the `~halotools.mock_observables` sub-package:
    
    >>> sample1 = np.vstack((x,y,z)).T
    
    Now we will choose random stellar masses for our galaxies:
    
    >>> stellar_mass = np.random.uniform(1e10, 1e12, Npts)
    
    Since we are interested in whether a point in ``sample1`` is isolated from other points 
    in ``sample1``, we set ``sample2`` to ``sample1`` and both ``marks1`` and ``marks2`` 
    equal to ``stellar_mass``. 
    
    >>> sample2 = sample1
    >>> marks1 = stellar_mass
    >>> marks2 = stellar_mass
    
    Referring to the Notes above for the definitions of the conditional marking functions, 
    we see that for this particular isolation criteria the appropriate ``cond_func`` is 2. 
    The reason is that this function only evaluates to *True* for those points in ``sample2`` 
    that are more massive than the ``sample1`` point under consideration. Thus the only 
    relevant points to consider as candidate neighbors are the more massive ones; all other 
    ``sample2`` points will be disregarded irrespective of their distance from the 
    ``sample1`` point under consideration.
    
    >>> r_max = 5.0
    >>> cond_func = 2
    
    >>> is_isolated = conditional_spherical_isolation(sample1, sample2, r_max, marks1, marks2, cond_func, period=Lbox)
